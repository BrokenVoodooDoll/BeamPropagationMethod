# BeamPropagationMethod
> *Read this in other languages: [Русский](README.ru.md)*
## Description
Simple realization of the beam propagation method based on FFT (Fast Fourier Tranform) for MATLAB/Octave.

Includes several scripts described by their names. One can change values denoted as "User Choices" to get different results.
The file "rect.m" contains the [rectangular function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangular_function).
